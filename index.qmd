Run multiple LLM predictions against a data frame. The predictions are processed 
row-wise over a specified column. It works using a pre-determined one-shot prompt,
along with the current row's content. `mall` has been implemented for both R
and Python. The prompt that is use will depend of the type of analysis needed. 

Currently, the included prompts perform the following: 

- [Sentiment analysis](#sentiment)
- [Text summarizing](#summarize)
- [Classify text](#classify)
- [Extract one, or several](#extract), specific pieces information from the text
- [Translate text](#translate)
- [Verify that something it true](#verify) about the text (binary)
- [Custom prompt](#custom-prompt)

This package is inspired by the SQL AI functions now offered by vendors such as
[Databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/en/large-language-models/ai-functions.html) 
and Snowflake.  `mall` uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to  interact with LLMs 
installed  locally. 

<img src="site/images/dplyr.png" style="float:left;margin-right:33px;margin-top:20px;" width="100" />

For **R**, that interaction takes place via the 
[`ollamar`](https://hauselin.github.io/ollama-r/) package. The functions are 
designed to easily work with piped commands, such as `dplyr`. 

```r
reviews |>
  llm_sentiment(review)
```

<img src="site/images/polars.png" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" width="120" />

For **Python**, `mall` is a library extension to [Polars](https://pola.rs/). To
interact with Ollama, it uses the official
[Python library](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python).

```python
reviews.llm.sentiment("review")
```

## Motivation

We want to new find ways to help data scientists use LLMs in their daily work. 
Unlike the familiar interfaces, such as chatting and code completion, this interface
runs your text data directly against the LLM.  

The LLM's flexibility, allows for it to adapt to the subject of your data, and 
provide surprisingly accurate predictions. This saves the data scientist the
need to write and tune an NLP model. 

In recent times, the capabilities of LLMs that can run locally in your computer 
have increased dramatically. This means that these sort of analysis can run
in your machine with good accuracy. Additionally, it makes it possible to take
advantage of LLM's at your institution, since the data will not leave the
corporate network. 

## Get started

- Install `mall` from Github

  
::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R
```r
pak::pak("mlverse/mall/r")
```

## Python
```python
pip install "mall @ git+https://git@github.com/mlverse/mall.git#subdirectory=python"
```
:::

- [Download Ollama from the official website](https://ollama.com/download)

- Install and start Ollama in your computer


::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R
- Install Ollama in your machine. The `ollamar` package's website provides this
[Installation guide](https://hauselin.github.io/ollama-r/#installation)

- Download an LLM model. For example, I have been developing this package using
Llama 3.2 to test. To get that model you can run: 
  ```r
  ollamar::pull("llama3.2")
  ```
  
## Python

- Install the official Ollama library
  ```python
  pip install ollama
  ```

- Download an LLM model. For example, I have been developing this package using
Llama 3.2 to test. To get that model you can run: 
  ```python
  import ollama
  ollama.pull('llama3.2')
  ```

#### With Databricks (R only)

If you pass a table connected to **Databricks** via `odbc`, `mall` will 
automatically use Databricks' LLM instead of Ollama. *You won't need Ollama 
installed if you are using Databricks only.*

`mall` will call the appropriate SQL AI function. For more information see our 
[Databricks article.](https://mlverse.github.io/mall/articles/databricks.html) 

## LLM functions

We will start with loading a very small data set contained in `mall`. It has
3 product reviews that we will use as the source of our examples.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{r}
library(mall)
data("reviews")

reviews
```

## Python

```{python}
#| include: false
import polars as pl
pl.Config(fmt_str_lengths=100)
pl.Config.set_tbl_hide_dataframe_shape(True)  
pl.Config.set_tbl_hide_column_data_types(True)
```


```{python}
import mall 
data = mall.MallData
reviews = data.reviews

reviews 
```
:::

```{python}
#| include: false
reviews.llm.use(options = dict(seed = 100), _cache = "_readme_cache")
```

### Sentiment

Automatically returns "positive", "negative", or "neutral" based on the text.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{r}
reviews |>
  llm_sentiment(review)
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[R reference page](reference/llm_sentiment.qmd) 

## Python 

```{python}
reviews.llm.sentiment("review")
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[Python reference page](reference/MallFrame.qmd#mall.MallFrame.sentiment) 

:::

### Summarize

There may be a need to reduce the number of words in a given text. Typically to 
make it easier to understand its intent. The function has an argument to 
control the maximum number of words to output 
(`max_words`):

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{r}
reviews |>
  llm_summarize(review, max_words = 5)
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[R reference page](reference/llm_summarize.qmd) 

## Python 

```{python}
reviews.llm.summarize("review", 5)
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[Python reference page](reference/MallFrame.qmd#mall.MallFrame.summarize) 

:::

### Classify

Use the LLM to categorize the text into one of the options you provide: 


::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{r}
reviews |>
  llm_classify(review, c("appliance", "computer"))
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[R reference page](reference/llm_classify.qmd) 

## Python 

```{python}
reviews.llm.classify("review", ["computer", "appliance"])
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[Python reference page](reference/MallFrame.qmd#mall.MallFrame.classify) 

:::

### Extract 

One of the most interesting use cases Using natural language, we can tell the 
LLM to return a specific part of the text. In the following example, we request
that the LLM return the product being referred to. We do this by simply saying 
"product". The LLM understands what we *mean* by that word, and looks for that
in the text.


::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{r}
reviews |>
  llm_extract(review, "product")
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[R reference page](reference/llm_extract.qmd) 

## Python 

```{python}
reviews.llm.extract("review", "product")
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[Python reference page](reference/MallFrame.qmd#mall.MallFrame.extract) 

:::

### Classify

Use the LLM to categorize the text into one of the options you provide: 


::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{r}
reviews |>
  llm_classify(review, c("appliance", "computer"))
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[R reference page](reference/llm_classify.qmd) 

## Python 

```{python}
reviews.llm.classify("review", ["computer", "appliance"])
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[Python reference page](reference/MallFrame.qmd#mall.MallFrame.classify) 

:::

### Verify 

This functions allows you to check and see if a statement is true, based
on the provided text. By default, it will return a 1 for "yes", and 0 for
"no". This can be customized.


::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{r}
reviews |>
  llm_verify(review, "is the customer happy with the purchase")
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[R reference page](reference/llm_verify.qmd) 

## Python 

```{python}
reviews.llm.verify("review", "is the customer happy with the purchase")
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[Python reference page](reference/MallFrame.qmd#mall.MallFrame.verify) 

:::



### Translate

As the title implies, this function will translate the text into a specified 
language. What is really nice, it is that you don't need to specify the language
of the source text. Only the target language needs to be defined.  The translation
accuracy will depend on the LLM

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{r}
reviews |>
  llm_translate(review, "spanish")
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[R reference page](reference/llm_translate.qmd) 

## Python 

```{python}
reviews.llm.translate("review", "spanish")
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[Python reference page](reference/MallFrame.qmd#mall.MallFrame.translate) 

:::

### Custom prompt

It is possible to pass your own prompt to the LLM, and have `mall` run it 
against each text entry:


::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{r}
my_prompt <- paste(
  "Answer a question.",
  "Return only the answer, no explanation",
  "Acceptable answers are 'yes', 'no'",
  "Answer this about the following text, is this a happy customer?:"
)

reviews |>
  llm_custom(review, my_prompt)
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[R reference page](reference/llm_custom.qmd) 

## Python 

```{python}
my_prompt = (
    "Answer a question."
    "Return only the answer, no explanation"
    "Acceptable answers are 'yes', 'no'"
    "Answer this about the following text, is this a happy customer?:"
)

reviews.llm.custom("review", prompt = my_prompt)
```

For more information and examples visit this function's 
[Python reference page](reference/MallFrame.qmd#mall.MallFrame.custom) 

:::

## Model selection and settings

You can set the model and its options to use when calling the LLM. In this case,
we refer to options as model specific things that can be set, such as seed or
temperature. 

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

Invoking an `llm` function will automatically initialize a model selection
if you don't have one selected yet. If there is only one option, it will 
pre-select it for you. If there are more than one available models, then `mall`
will present you as menu selection so you can select which model you wish to 
use.

Calling `llm_use()` directly will let you specify the model and backend to use.
You can also setup additional arguments that will be passed down to the 
function that actually runs the prediction. In the case of Ollama, that function
is [`chat()`](https://hauselin.github.io/ollama-r/reference/chat.html). 

The model to use, and other options can be set for the current R session

```{r}
#| eval: false
llm_use("ollama", "llama3.2", seed = 100, temperature = 0)
```


## Python 

The model and options to be used will be defined at the Polars data frame 
object level. If not passed, the default model will be **llama3.2**.

```{python}
#| eval: false
reviews.llm.use("ollama", "llama3.2", options = dict(seed = 100))
```

:::

#### Results caching 

By default `mall` caches the requests and corresponding results from a given
LLM run. Each response is saved as individual JSON files. By default, the folder
name is `_mall_cache`. The folder name can be customized, if needed. Also, the
caching can be turned off by setting the argument to empty (`""`).

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R


```{r}
#| eval: false
llm_use(.cache = "_my_cache")
```

To turn off:

```{r}
#| eval: false
llm_use(.cache = "")
```

## Python 

```{python}
#| eval: false
reviews.llm.use(_cache = "my_cache")
```

To turn off:

```{python}
#| eval: false
reviews.llm.use(_cache = "")
```

:::

For more information see the [Caching Results](articles/caching.qmd) article. 

## Key considerations

The main consideration is **cost**. Either, time cost, or money cost.

If using this method with an LLM locally available, the cost will be a long 
running time. Unless using a very specialized LLM, a given LLM is a general model. 
It was fitted using a vast amount of data. So determining a response for each 
row, takes longer than if using a manually created NLP model. The default model
used in Ollama is [Llama 3.2](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2), 
which was fitted using 3B parameters. 

If using an external LLM service, the consideration will need to be for the 
billing costs of using such service. Keep in mind that you will be sending a lot
of data to be evaluated. 

Another consideration is the novelty of this approach. Early tests are 
providing encouraging results. But you, as an user, will still need to keep
in mind that the predictions will not be infallible, so always check the output.
At this time, I think the best use for this method, is for a quick analysis.


## Vector functions (R only)

`mall` includes functions that expect a vector, instead of a table, to run the
predictions. This should make it easier to test things, such as custom prompts
or results of specific text. Each `llm_` function has a corresponding `llm_vec_`
function:

```{r}
llm_vec_sentiment("I am happy")
```

```{r}
llm_vec_translate("Este es el mejor dia!", "english")
```
