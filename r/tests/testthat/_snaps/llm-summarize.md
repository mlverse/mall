      1                 This has been the best TV I've ever used. Great screen, and sound.
      2          I regret buying this laptop. It is too slow and the keyboard is too noisy
      3 Not sure how to feel about my new washing machine. Great color, but hard to figure
                              .summary
      1    great tv with good features
      2  laptop purchase was a mistake
      3 having mixed feelings about it
