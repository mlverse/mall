This function will set to `NA` any response not in the options |\n| x | A vector that contains the text to be analyzed |\n\n\n\n## Value\n `llm_custom` returns a `data.frame` or `tbl` object. `llm_vec_custom` returns a vector that is the same length as `x`. \n\n\n## Examples\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n \n \nlibrary(mall) \n \ndata(\"reviews\") \n \nllm_use(\"ollama\", \"llama3.2\", seed = 100, .silent = TRUE) \n \nmy_prompt <- paste( \n  \"Answer a question.\", \n  \"Return only the answer, no explanation\", \n  \"Acceptable answers are 'yes', 'no'\", \n  \"Answer this about the following text, is this a happy customer?:\" \n) \n \nreviews |> \n  llm_custom(review, my_prompt) \n#> # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#>   review                                                                   .pred\n#>   <chr>                                                                    <chr>\n#> 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used.
