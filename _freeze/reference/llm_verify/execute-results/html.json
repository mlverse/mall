It is positional. The first item is expected to be value to return if the statement about the provided text is true, and the second if it is not. Defaults to: `factor(c(1, 0))` |\n| pred_name | A character vector with the name of the new column where the prediction will be placed |\n| additional_prompt | Inserts this text into the prompt sent to the LLM |\n| x | A vector that contains the text to be analyzed |\n| preview | It returns the R call that would have been used to run the prediction. It only returns the first record in `x`. Defaults to `FALSE` Applies to vector function only. |\n\n\n\n## Value\n`llm_verify` returns a `data.frame` or `tbl` object. `llm_vec_verify` returns a vector that is the same length as `x`.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\n\nlibrary(mall)\n\ndata(\"reviews\")\n\nllm_use(\"ollama\", \"llama3.2\", seed = 100, .silent = TRUE)\n\n# By default it will return 1 for 'true', and 0 for 'false',\n# the new column will be a factor type\nllm_verify(reviews, review, \"is the customer happy\")\n#> # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#>   review                                                                 .verify\n#>   <chr>                                                                  <fct>  \n#> 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used.
