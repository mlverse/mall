Defaults to 10. |\n| pred_name | A character vector with the name of the new column where the prediction will be placed |\n| additional_prompt | Inserts this text into the prompt sent to the LLM |\n| x | A vector that contains the text to be analyzed |\n| preview | It returns the R call that would have been used to run the prediction. It only returns the first record in `x`. Defaults to `FALSE` Applies to vector function only. |\n\n\n\n## Value\n `llm_summarize` returns a `data.frame` or `tbl` object. `llm_vec_summarize` returns a vector that is the same length as `x`. \n\n\n## Examples\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n \nlibrary(mall) \n \ndata(\"reviews\") \n \nllm_use(\"ollama\", \"llama3.2\", seed = 100, .silent = TRUE) \n \n# Use max_words to set the maximum number of words to use for the summary \nllm_summarize(reviews, review, max_words = 5) \n#> # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#>   review                                        .summary                      \n#>   <chr>                                         <chr>                         \n#> 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used.
